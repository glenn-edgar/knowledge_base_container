# Expert Performance Analysis Guide

## What Industrial Experts Look For in Performance Logs

### 🔍 **1. Baseline Establishment & Trending**

#### **Baseline Metrics** (First Priority)
```sql
-- Establish normal operating ranges
SELECT 
    node_name,
    AVG(cpu_total_pct) as avg_cpu,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY cpu_total_pct) as p95_cpu,
    AVG(mem_available_mb::float / mem_total_mb * 100) as avg_mem_free_pct,
    AVG(temperature_c) as avg_temp
FROM monitor_samples_ring 
WHERE node_flag = TRUE 
    AND sample_time > (EXTRACT(epoch FROM NOW()) - 604800) -- Last week
GROUP BY node_name;
```

#### **Key Baseline Questions:**
- What are normal CPU, memory, and I/O patterns during business hours?
- What's the typical temperature range under normal load?
- How do weekends/nights differ from peak hours?
- What's the natural variance in these metrics?

### 🚨 **2. Anomaly Detection & Outliers**

#### **CPU Anomalies**
```sql
-- Detect CPU spikes and sustained high usage
SELECT 
    sample_time,
    node_name,
    cpu_total_pct,
    cpu_iowait_pct,
    cpu_system_pct,
    load_1m,
    procs_running
FROM monitor_samples_ring 
WHERE node_flag = TRUE 
    AND (cpu_total_pct > 80 OR load_1m > 8 OR cpu_iowait_pct > 20)
ORDER BY sample_time DESC;
```

#### **Memory Pressure Indicators**
```sql
-- Memory exhaustion patterns
SELECT 
    sample_time,
    node_name,
    mem_available_mb,
    (mem_available_mb::float / mem_total_mb * 100) as mem_free_pct,
    swap_used_mb,
    (swap_used_mb::float / swap_total_mb * 100) as swap_used_pct
FROM monitor_samples_ring 
WHERE node_flag = TRUE 
    AND (mem_available_mb::float / mem_total_mb < 0.10 OR swap_used_mb > 0)
ORDER BY sample_time DESC;
```

#### **Expert Focus:**
- **CPU steal time** - indicates virtualization/cloud contention
- **I/O wait spikes** - storage bottlenecks affecting performance  
- **Context switch rates** - excessive task switching overhead
- **Memory pressure** - leading indicator of performance degradation

    COUNT(*) as samples
FROM monitor_samples_ring 
WHERE node_flag = TRUE 
    AND sample_time > (EXTRACT(epoch FROM NOW()) - 86400) -- Last 24h
GROUP BY EXTRACT(hour FROM to_timestamp(sample_time))
ORDER BY hour_of_day;
```

FROM monitor_samples_ring c1
JOIN monitor_samples_ring s ON c1.sample_time = s.sample_time 
    AND c1.node_name = s.node_name 
    AND s.node_flag = TRUE
WHERE c1.node_flag = FALSE 
    AND c1.sample_time > (EXTRACT(epoch FROM NOW()) - 3600)
ORDER BY c1.sample_time DESC, c1.cpu_total_pct DESC;
```
